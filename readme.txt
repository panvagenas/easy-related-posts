== Description ==
Easy Related Posts is a WordPress plugin that displays posts related to the one a user is currently reading.
Easy Related Posts can display related posts in main content area or in sidebars through a widget.
Equipped with 3 eye catching fully responsive themes, supports basic modifications on them from admin panel. It also has a theme system that let you modify or write your own themes to match you personal needs.
Through an intuitive algorithm it creates “relations” between posts and rates them based on posts categories and/or tags in a way so these ratings are as much as accurate they can be.
